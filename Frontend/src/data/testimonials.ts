      'We purchased a villa at IAC Serenity in Bandlaguda Jagir and the entire experience was seamless. From the first site visit to the registration, the IAC team was transparent and supportive. The construction quality is outstanding — Italian marble, Kohler fittings, everything as promised. Our family moved in on time and we couldn\'t be happier.',

      'Being an IT professional in HITEC City, location was everything for me. IAC Skyline in Mehdipatnam is perfectly situated — 15 minutes to office with zero highway hassle. The 3 BHK layout is very practical, and the clubhouse amenities rival five-star resorts. Highly recommend IAC to anyone looking in Hyderabad.',

      'After retirement, my husband and I wanted a peaceful home near nature. IAC Shamshabad Greens near Hyderabad was the perfect answer. The gated community is safe, the neighbours are wonderful, and the morning walks along the jogging track with garden views are priceless. Great value for money too.',

      'I invested in a commercial space at IAC Business Hub in HITEC City for my CA practice. The building infrastructure is truly Grade A — centralized AC, high-speed lifts, and excellent façade. The IAC team even helped me with loan processing through their consulting arm. One-stop shop for real estate!',

      'Buying property from overseas is always nerve-wracking, but IAC\'s NRI desk made it effortless. Video calls for site visits, digital documentation, and power-of-attorney support — everything was handled professionally. My penthouse at IAC Horizon in Jubilee Hills is my dream retirement home. Thank you, IAC!',

      'I was looking for an affordable yet quality home for my family in Rajendra Nagar. IAC Heritage Homes fit the bill perfectly — good construction, proper title, and within budget. The legal advisory team helped me verify all documents and the loan consulting saved me at least 0.5% on interest. Very professional company.',
